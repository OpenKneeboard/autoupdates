This will also forward the mouse/tablet for *most* applications, but not 'UWP' apps; these are mostly Windows Store apps, or apps included with Windows, such as the calculator.\r\n- Added UI for renaming tabs\r\n- Added in-game real-world clock\r\n- Added in-game DCS mission clock (local and zulu)\r\n- Fix crash when switching profiles if no wintab tablet driver is installed\r\n- SET_TAB remote now lets you (optionally) specify a kneeboard\r\n- SET_TAB remote now supports setting the current tab by position, in addition to by ID or Title\r\n- Added SET_PROFILE remote (supports by ID or name)\r\n- Added \"[Administrator]\" to title bar when running as administrator\r\n- Added option to run as administrator, normal user, or just go along with however it was launched\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes and Improvements\r\n\r\n- Wacom tablets are now more reliable when OpenKneeboard is not the active Window (thanks to @BeamRider). No change on Huion devices due to a bug in their wintab implementation.\r\n- Flipped default of Varjo Y-axis quirk; this seems to no longer be needed\r\n- Replaced the modern file/folder picker windows with the Windows Vista ones, as [the modern ones crash as administrator](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/2504)\r\n- Made autoupdater compatible with MSI installers\r\n- Fixed bug which would make the 'add tab' menu duplicate the tab types every time the profile is changed\r\n- Improved efficency of DCS -> OpenKneeboard communication\r\n- Rewrote how the in-game UI is constructed. This makes it much easier to add new features with in-game UI, such as the new clocks.",
