This was already required for full functionality.\r\n- Fixes intermittent crashes when folders containing PDFs are loaded\r\n- Fix mission tab continuously reloading if username contains more than 8 characters, leading to Windows returning a classic DOS `ABCDEF~1` path instead of the actual path of the temporary directory\r\n- Fixed auto-update sometimes closing OpenKneeboard before the installer for the new version had started\r\n- No longer requires the windows app runtime package; this should fix problems with MSIX installation, however it makes the package somewhat larger\r\n- The OpenXR API layer name is now `XR_APILAYER_FREDEMMOTT_OpenKneeboard` instead of `XR_APILAYER_NOVENDOR_OpenKneeboard` (vendor ID added in OpenXR 1.0.25)",
