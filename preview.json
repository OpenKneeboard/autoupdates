This should have no effect on most people, but makes things more likely to work by default for people with multiple graphics cards.\r\n- It is no longer necessary to restart games when changing rendering options in OpenKneeboard\r\n- It is no longer necessary to restart games when upgrading OpenKneeboard, though probably a good idea :p\r\n- Added note and recenter button next to the VR position options\r\n- Updated all dependencies for improved reliability and performance, especially for PDF rendering\r\n- Fix crash when loading PDFs that contain invalid internal hyperlinks, e.g. a 10 page PDF containing a link to 'page 20'\r\n- \"All Users\" OpenXR installations are now compatible with \"OpenXR Tools for Windows Mixed Reality\"; as this tool is sandboxed, the information it displays can be misleading - I recommend [OpenXR-Explorer](https://github.com/maluoi/openxr-explorer) instead.\r\n"
